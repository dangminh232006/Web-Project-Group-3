# Apple Careers - recruitment website

COS10026 Web Technology Project
**Assessment 2: Applied Web Project - Part 1** (group component, 70 marks) - Group 3

A static recruitment website for **Apple** (the Apple Online Store web team in Sydney),
built with HTML5 and CSS3 only. No JavaScript, no frameworks, no build step.

- Live site: https://dangminh232006.github.io/Web-Project-Group-3/
- Repository: https://github.com/dangminh232006/Web-Project-Group-3
- Jira board: https://cos10026-group3.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WWTP/summary

> This is a student project. It is **not affiliated with, authorised or endorsed by Apple Inc.**
> Both vacancies, the salaries and the hiring process are coursework content, not real job ads.
> Apple and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. The application form only sends data to
> the Swinburne test script (`formtest.php`).

## Pages

| Page | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Logo, company name, slogan, description and image; CSS background graphic; search box with button; hiring-process table with merged cells (`rowspan`, `colspan`); Acknowledgement of Country and inclusive hiring statement; footer with Jira, GitHub and email links |
| `jobs.html` | Two job descriptions (`AFE26` Front-End Web Developer, `AUX26` Accessibility and UX Designer), each a `<section>` with salary, reporting line, responsibilities, essential (`<ol>`) and preferable (`<ul>`) requirements; `<aside>` floated right at 25% |
| `apply.html` | Job application form, `method="post"` to `https://mercury.swin.edu.au/it000000/formtest.php`, HTML5 validation with `pattern`, `maxlength`, `required`, `type="email"`; layout with CSS Grid |
| `about.html` | Group name and class details (nested list), selected project brief, members, contributions and quotes (definition list), temporary member portraits in a bordered `<figure>`; full group photo pending |
| `styles.css` | Shared base, navigation, footer, responsive and print styles |
| `index.css`, `jobs.css`, `apply.css`, `about.css` | CSS specific to each matching HTML page |

The shared footer lists all four student contacts and embeds a Google Map of Apple Park beside the Pages links. Application results open in a new tab, preserving the original form and its answers.

Every page has the four meta tags taught in Week 1 (charset, description, keywords, author), the
viewport meta tag (Week 5), the shared navigation and footer, one embedded `<style>` example and one
inline `style` example (brief requirement).

The group and individual Canvas submissions have not yet been uploaded.
