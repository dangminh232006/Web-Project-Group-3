# Apple Careers - recruitment website

COS10026 Web Technology Project
**Assessment 2: Applied Web Project - Part 1** (group component, 70 marks) - Group 3

A static recruitment website for **Apple** (the Apple Online Store web team in Sydney),
built with HTML5 and CSS3 only. No JavaScript, no frameworks, no build step.

- Live site: https://dangminh232006.github.io/Web-Project-Group-3/
- Repository: https://github.com/dangminh232006/Web-Project-Group-3
- Jira board: https://cos10026-group3.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WWTP/summary

> This is a student project. It is **not affiliated with, authorised or endorsed by Apple Inc.**
> Both vacancies, the salaries and the hiring process are coursework content, not real job ads.
> Apple and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. The application form only sends data to
> the Swinburne test script (`formtest.php`).

## Pages

| Page | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Logo, company name, slogan, description and image; CSS background graphic; search box with button; hiring-process table with merged cells (`rowspan`, `colspan`); Acknowledgement of Country and inclusive hiring statement; footer with Jira, GitHub and email links |
| `jobs.html` | Two job descriptions (`AFE26` Front-End Web Developer, `AUX26` Accessibility and UX Designer), each a `<section>` with salary, reporting line, responsibilities, essential (`<ol>`) and preferable (`<ul>`) requirements; `<aside>` floated right at 25% |
| `apply.html` | Job application form, `method="post"` to `https://mercury.swin.edu.au/it000000/formtest.php`, HTML5 validation with `pattern`, `maxlength`, `required`, `type="email"`; layout with CSS Grid |
| `about.html` | Group name and class details (nested list), selected project brief, members, contributions and quotes (definition list), group photo in a bordered `<figure>` |
| `styles.css` | Shared base, navigation, footer, responsive and print styles |
| `index.css`, `jobs.css`, `apply.css`, `about.css` | CSS specific to each matching HTML page |

The shared footer lists all four student contacts and embeds a Google Map of Apple Park beside the Pages links. Application results open in a new tab, preserving the original form and its answers.

Every page has the four meta tags taught in Week 1 (charset, description, keywords, author), the
viewport meta tag (Week 5), the shared navigation and footer, one embedded `<style>` example and one
inline `style` example (brief requirement).

## Before submission (team to do)

Search for the yellow placeholders and replace each one with real details:

```bash
grep -n 'class="placeholder"' about.html
```

1. Page owned and other work for Le Ho Hoang Lan, Nguyen Quang Thang and Tran Vo Nhat Minh
   (names and student IDs are already filled in).
2. Replace `images/group-photo.jpg` with a real group photo (JPEG, under 300 KB, keep 800 x 450 or update
   `width`/`height` in `about.html`), then delete the "Before submission" box at the top of `about.html`.
3. Check the Jira board has epics, user stories, tasks and two sprints, and that the tutor has access.
4. Make sure GitHub Pages is switched on and the live link works (the repository must allow Pages).

Full list: `docs/release-checklist.md`.

## Running locally

Double-click `index.html`, or serve the parent folder to test it the way GitHub Pages serves it:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8777
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8777/applied-web-project-part1/index.html`.

## Acknowledgements

- Generative AI: Claude (Anthropic, Claude Opus 5.5, October 2026) was used for code suggestions,
  page wording and the two illustrations. The prompt used, translated from Vietnamese, was:
  "Complete Applied Web Project Part 1 for me. Our company is Apple. Meet every requirement
  of the brief at the highest marking level, and only use the HTML and CSS taught in the unit."
  The group reviewed and edited AI-assisted material before use. Code comments containing
  these acknowledgements were removed on 18 October 2026 at the coordinator's request;
  this README record does not meet the unit's in-code acknowledgement requirement.
- External sources, including the Devicon logo glyph, Apple material and map embed, are listed
  in `docs/references.md`. Their in-code source comments were also removed.
